# simple-chat

This is a quick coding exercise in building a (non-production) chat app using just JavaScript, HTML, node.js, express, and bodyParser. 

## You can run it by following these steps:

1. Clone this repo, 
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "node index.js"
4. Open 1, 2, or 3 browser windows to address "localhost:3000" 
5. The chat client should open up in the browser.
6. You can enter a name, and a message.
7. Click send.

The message you send will appear in all the brower windows with this client.

The message list has a maximum length of 20 messages.
