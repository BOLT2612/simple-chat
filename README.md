# simple-chat

This is a quick coding exercise in building a (non-production) chat app using just JavaScript, HTML, node.js, express, and bodyParser. 

## You can run it by following these steps:
Clone this repo, 

Run "npm install"

Run "node index.js"

Open 1, 2, or 3 browser windows open "localhost:3000" 

The chat client should open up in the browser.

You can enter a name, and a message, and click send.

The message you send will appear in all the brower windows with this client.
